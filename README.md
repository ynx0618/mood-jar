🌸 Mood Jar — Emotional Sediment Tracker

  A soft, aesthetic emotional journaling experience where feelings don’t disappear: they settle, layer, and accumulate like sand in a jar. Instead of tracking productivity, Mood Jar visualizes your emotional landscape over time.

✨ Concept

  Mood Jar transforms daily emotions into a living artifact.
  Each time you log a mood:
  - A colored sediment layer drops into the jar
  - Emotions stack visually over time
  - Colors blend like emotional geology
  - Your jar becomes a reflection of your inner world

Think: Digital emotion bottle × memory jar × sand art therapy.

  🎨 Design Philosophy

      Mood Jar is built around three ideas:
      
      Emotions accumulate, not disappear.
      
      Visualization fosters reflection.
      
      Soft aesthetics make emotional tracking inviting.
      
      It’s less about productivity — more about emotional presence.
